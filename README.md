# Fun python scripts
These scripts were built to test out various python concepts in a lighthearted fashion.

Draw shapes using recursion with the python's turtle module:
- recursiveHeart.py
- recursiveSnowflake.py
- recursiveSpiral.py
- recursiveTree.py

For example, running "python recursiveTree.py" in a terminal will draw a fractal tree:

"python recursiveHeart.py" will draw a heart:
